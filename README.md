# Lagos-House-Price-Prediction-Python

# Project Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict residential house prices in Lagos, Nigeria. By analyzing a range of real estate features — including location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more — the model helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions in the property market.

# Project Objectives

- Build a regression model to predict house prices in Lagos.
- Analyze and preprocess housing datasets to handle missing data and outliers.
- Identify the most influential features affecting property values.
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Deploy a simple web app using Streamlit (optional step).

## Dataset

The dataset contains key real estate information such as:
- Location (e.g., Lekki, Ikeja, Ajah)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- House type (duplex, bungalow, etc.)
- Price (target variable)
- Size (square footage or plot size)
- Amenities and features

# Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab
- Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Streamlit (for app deployment)

# Model Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Convert categorical data and create useful derived metrics.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize price distributions, outliers, and feature correlations.
4. **Model Training**: Fit regression models using train/test split.
5. **Evaluation**: Use RMSE, R² score, and MAE to assess model performance.
6. **Prediction**: Use trained model to predict prices for new/unseen data.

# Future Improvements

- Integrate real-time property listings via APIs.
- Deploy an interactive web app for users to input property details.
- Improve model performance using hyperparameter tuning and stacking techniques.
